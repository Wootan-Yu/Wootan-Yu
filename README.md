# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Martin Padayao

I'm a **Computer Engineering student** at **Polytechnic University of the Philippines** with a strong foundation in **C++** and **Python** programming. My primary focus is on **game development** and **computer graphics**, specifically in building **simulations from scratch** using **SFML**. I love solving complex problems and creating interactive experiences through programming and physics-based simulations.

## ðŸŽ® Projects

Here are a few examples of projects that showcase my skills:

1. **Physics Engine with SFML**:  
   Developed a custom physics simulation engine from scratch using SFML, focusing on collision detection, object interaction, and realistic movement within a 2D environment.

2. **Geometry Wars: A Simple Game made with SFML**:  
   Created a game where you shoot moving enemies spawned at random location, implementing Entity-Component system (ECS) and utilizing C++ and SFML Library for game development.

3. **IExercise: A Cross-Platform App with Flutter**:  
   Developed a mobile app using Flutter that provides for tracking and performing various exercise routines. The app helps users stay fit and motivated by offering customized workout plans, exercise tracking, and progress monitoring.

4. **Ray Casting with SFML**:
   Implemented a ray casting system in SFML to simulate 2D light rays and line-of-sight calculations. The system is optimized using data-oriented design principles to improve performance and efficiency, handling large-scale environments and real-time interactions.

5. **Flocking Simulation with SFML**:
   Developed a 2D flocking behavior simulation using SFML and C++ to model collective animal movement such as bird flocks or fish schools. The system implements classic boid algorithmsâ€”Separation, Alignment, and Cohesionâ€”to produce emergent group behavior in real-time.
