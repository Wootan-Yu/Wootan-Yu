  - imGui
  - Python
  - Flutter (for Mobile Development)


## üîß Skills & Expertise

- **C++ Programming**: Proficient in developing high-performance applications, focusing on memory management, algorithms, and object-oriented design.
- **Python Programming**: Comfortable with scripting, automation, and data manipulation, leveraging Python for both academic and personal projects.
- **Game Development**: Knowledgeable in physics engines, and graphical rendering. I work on interactive projects that involve physics-based challenges.
- **Simulations**: Specialized in creating **simulations** using SFML, including light, particles, and other physics forces, from scratch.
- **Computer Graphics**: Skilled in implementing 2D graphics using SFML, enabling dynamic and visually rich simulations.
- **Mobile Development (Flutter)**: Experienced in building cross-platform mobile apps using Flutter, developing modern, performant applications with a focus on user experience.


## üéÆ Projects

Here are a few examples of projects that showcase my skills:

1. **Physics Engine with SFML**:  
   Developed a custom physics simulation engine from scratch using SFML, focusing on collision detection, object interaction, and realistic movement within a 2D environment.

2. **Geometry Wars: A Simple Game made with SFML**:  
   Created a game where you shoot moving enemies spawned at random location, implementing Entity-Component system (ECS) and utilizing C++ and SFML Library for game development.

3. **IExercise: A Cross-Platform App with Flutter**:  
   Developed a mobile app using Flutter that provides for tracking and performing various exercise routines. The app helps users stay fit and motivated by offering customized workout plans, exercise tracking, and progress monitoring.

4. **Ray Casting with SFML**:
   Implemented a ray casting system in SFML to simulate 2D light rays and line-of-sight calculations. The system is optimized using data-oriented design principles to improve performance and efficiency, handling large-scale environments and real-time interactions.

5. **Flocking Simulation with SFML**: Developed a 2D flocking behavior simulation using SFML and C++ to model collective animal movement such as bird flocks or fish schools. The system implements classic boid algorithms‚ÄîSeparation, Alignment, and Cohesion‚Äîto produce emergent group behavior in real-time.

## üå± Currently Learning

- Exploring **2D and 3D graphics** using SFML and openGL.
- Improving performance optimization for physics-based simulations.
