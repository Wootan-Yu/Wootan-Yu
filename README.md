## ðŸŽ® Projects

1. **Vector Field Simulation with Particles**   
      This project visualizes a vector field combined with target-seeking particles. The particles are influenced by the field's direction and dynamically navigate toward a target tile. The simulation efficiently    handles 100,000+ particles in real-time, making it ideal for performance-heavy simulations.

2. **Custom Physics Engine**   
      Developed a custom physics simulation engine from scratch using SFML, focusing on collision detection, object interaction, and realistic movement within a 2D environment.

3. **Geometry Wars (Game)**   
      Created a game where players shoot moving enemies spawned at random locations. Implemented an Entity-Component System (ECS) architecture, utilizing C++ and SFML for game development.

4. **IExercise (Mobile App)**   
      Developed a mobile app using Flutter to help users track and perform various exercise routines. The app offers customized workout plans, tracks exercise progress, and motivates users to stay fit.

5. **Ray Casting System**   
      Built a ray casting system in SFML to simulate 2D light rays and line-of-sight calculations, which can be used for various applications such as vision or lighting simulations.

6. **Flocking Simulation**   
      Implemented a 2D flocking behavior simulation using SFML and C++ to model collective animal movement (e.g., bird flocks, fish schools). The system uses classic Boid algorithmsâ€”Separation, Alignment, and Cohesionâ€”to produce emergent group behavior in real-time.
